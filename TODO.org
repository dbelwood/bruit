* Bruit - a text editor inspired by Emacs, written in Racket

** Goals
- Multi-frame, multi-buffer text editing
- Easy key-mapping management
- External process integration
- Easily write new functions for the editor and save them in the editor (Lighttable-esque)

** Todos
*** TODO Launch app with single frame and buffer in which text can be entered
